GML RANSAC Matlab Toolbox v 0.1
===============================

0. Intro
--------
  Before using this toolbox, please see the License.txt file!

  You can learn about the implemented algorithms here:
  http://research.graphicon.ru/machine-learning/gml-ransac-matlab-toolbox-2.html


1. How to Use
-------------
  All RANSAC algorithms are implemented as MATLAB functions and 
  located in "SAC" direcory. Other Scrips and directorie(s) are
  just example data.

  To get specific help for any function, you should type:
  "help <function_name>"
  where <function_name> - is one of the functions in "SAC" direcory,
  and you'll get full usage help.


2. Some Exmples
---------------

  To view "how it works", you can run "line_ex.m" without any
  argument. It will produce the figure, with the difference of
  line estimation by different SAC algorithms. Also it wil print
  some statistic data at main terminal window.
